Introduction

Tennis is a sport, that like many others, depends on a lot of things to see who wins. It's a combination of technique, speed, and strength, that all reflect how 
good a player is at tennis. However, this makes it difficult to predict which player will win, and is especially difficult when looking at the best tennis players,
that all have different capabilities. This project will aim to determine which tennis player will win, given a variety of stats like age, double faults, height, etc. 
It will be determined using the dataset for the top 500 best tennis players from 2017 to 2019.
